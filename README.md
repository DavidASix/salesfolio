# üìù SalesFolio

Welcome to **SalesFolio**! This project is now archived, but it once lived and breathed as a exciting new way for sales people to share their performance. Now, it's open-sourced for your inspiration, and my nostalgia.

## üöÄ What Was SalesFolio?

SalesFolio was a sharable Sales Portfolio designed to help sales people of all types easily track and showcase their sales achievements. With SalesFolio, you could log cold calls, upload deal information, and add videos. To boost credibility, we planned to included a peer verification feature, allowing your colleagues to confirm the validity of your claims.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap (The Plans That Once Were)

Had SalesFolio continued, the dream roadmap looked something like this:
- **Peer Verification:** A social aspect allowing you to verify peers sales
- **Internal Verification:** Upload a document proving your sale and you'll receive a badge showing your confirmed deal values
- **Leaderboards:** Gamified leaderboards specific to your company, city, or country
- **AI-Powered Suggestions:** Get suggestions on how your cold calls & emails could have been improved through LLM integration
- **Enterprise Build:** Companies could purchase an enterprise license to view the statistics around best sales people in a region for talent acquisition

## üì¶ Why Open Source Now?

It's important to know when to pivot. Another startup in the same market beat us to the punch on this idea, and they executed very well. While we could have pushed on, the SalesFolio team felt that it was better to shift focus as we would have launched a few months after this other company, and their product was already looking great.
